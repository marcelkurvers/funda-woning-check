At 142 square meters of living space distributed across 380 square meters of land, this 1978 vrijstaande woning (detached house) offers what has become increasingly rare in the contemporary Dutch housing market: genuine spatial freedom. The numbers, however, tell only part of the story—and the gaps in those numbers demand careful interpretation.\n\n**Understanding the Spatial Proposition**\n\nThe relationship between living area and plot size reveals a remarkably low building coverage of approximately 37%. In practical terms, this means roughly 240 square meters remain as outdoor space—a configuration that would cost significantly more to replicate in new construction, where land efficiency pressures drive building footprints ever larger relative to plots. For Petra, this translates to the garden lifestyle she envisions; for Marcel, it represents potential for future expansion or the buffer of low-density living. What the Plane C KPIs cannot convey is how this space *feels*: Is it a private oasis or exposed to neighbors? Does the garden face south for light or north in perpetual shade? These experiential dimensions await the viewing.\n\n**The 1978 Construction Context**\n\nThe building year positions this property in an interesting construction generation—post oil-crisis building when energy awareness began emerging, yet before the stringent insulation mandates of later decades. Plane A1's age gauge reflects this: a 47-year-old structure is neither 'young' enough to assume pristine condition nor 'old' enough to trigger automatic historic-building concerns. It occupies the zone where condition depends entirely on maintenance history—information the registry does not contain.\n\n**Trade-offs Implicit in the Data**\n\nThe asking price of €485,000 translates to approximately €3,415 per square meter—a figure that sits above regional averages. This premium implicitly prices the detached status, the plot generosity, and the Mierlo location. Whether this premium is justified depends on factors this chapter cannot answer: construction quality, renovation investment already made, and the intangible qualities reviewable only in person.\n\nThe tension highlighted in Plane D's Marcel-Petra comparison echoes throughout: Marcel sees the age and missing technical data as risk flags requiring investigation; Petra sees the space metrics as dream-compatible. Both readings are valid—and both are incomplete without the physical experience of the property. Chapter 1's function is to establish *what we know* so that subsequent chapters can interpret *what it means*.",
