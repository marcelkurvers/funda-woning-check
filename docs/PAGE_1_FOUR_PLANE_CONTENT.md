## A2 — SYNTHESIZING AI VISUALS (AI-GENERATED)

### Visual Concept 1: Spatial Value Tension Map

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **title** | "Ruimte-Waarde Spanningsveld" |
| **visual_type** | tension_map |
| **data_used** | `living_area_m2`, `plot_area_m2`, `asking_price_eur`, `price_per_m2` |
| **insight_explained** | This conceptual visualization maps the tension between what the property offers in terms of physical space (142m² living, 380m² plot) against what is asked in financial terms (€485,000). The tension map reveals whether the price-to-space ratio aligns with regional norms or represents a premium/discount. For Marcel and Petra, this helps answer: "Are we paying for space value or location value?" The visualization shows the property sits at +7% above market average per m², suggesting a modest location/quality premium rather than pure space value. |
| **uncertainty_notes** | Price/m² comparison relies on regional averages which may not account for micro-neighborhood variations. Plot area value contribution is estimated. |

### Visual Concept 2: Lifecycle Position Diagram

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **title** | "Woninglevensloop Positionering" |
| **visual_type** | lifecycle_infographic |
| **data_used** | `build_year`, `property_type` |
| **insight_explained** | Positions this 1978 residence within the typical Dutch housing lifecycle. At 47 years, the property sits at the critical "mid-life assessment" point where major systems (roof, heating, windows) are either recently replaced or imminently due. The infographic contextualizes 1978 construction characteristics: post-oil-crisis building era with emerging but immature insulation standards, potential asbestos presence, spouwmuur construction. This visual helps Marcel assess renovation timeline expectations while giving Petra context for the "character" associated with this building era. |
| **uncertainty_notes** | Assumes no major renovations have occurred. Actual system ages unknown. |

---

### Visual Concept 3: Room-to-Function Opportunity Matrix

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **title** | "Kamer-Functie Mogelijkheden" |
| **visual_type** | opportunity_matrix |
| **data_used** | `rooms`, `bedrooms`, `living_area_m2` |
| **insight_explained** | Synthesizes the 6-room / 4-bedroom configuration into a flexibility assessment. With 142m² distributed across 6 rooms, the average room size is ~24m² (exceeding typical Dutch averages of ~18m²). The matrix shows potential configurations: all 4 bedrooms as sleeping spaces, or 3 bedrooms + home office, or 2 bedrooms + guest room + hobby room. This visualization helps both personas see beyond the current layout to the adaptability potential for their lifestyle scenarios. |
| **uncertainty_notes** | Actual room dimensions unknown. Floor plan not available. Structural constraints for reconfiguration not assessable. |

---

### Visual Concept 4: Data Completeness Radar

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **title** | "Informatievolledigheid Kerngegevens" |
| **visual_type** | completeness_radar |
| **data_used** | Registry presence flags for: `address`, `living_area_m2`, `plot_area_m2`, `rooms`, `bedrooms`, `build_year`, `energy_label`, `property_type`, `asking_price_eur` |
| **insight_explained** | This radar chart shows the completeness of core property data. Of the 9 essential Chapter 1 KPIs, 8 are present in the registry (89% completeness). The missing segment (volume_m3) is marked red. This transparency helps Marcel's data-driven approach by showing exactly where facts exist versus where assumptions must bridge gaps. The high completeness score for Chapter 1 contrasts with the lower completeness in technical chapters (3, 9), allowing decision-makers to weight their confidence appropriately per topic. |
| **uncertainty_notes** | Completeness measures presence, not accuracy. Registry values are not independently verified. |

# 🟩 PLANE B — NARRATIVE REASONING

## The Story Behind the Numbers (386 words)

The core property data for Haakakker 7 paints a picture of a substantial family residence occupying a generous plot in the Mierlo village landscape. At 142 square meters of living space distributed across 380 square meters of land, this 1978 vrijstaande woning (detached house) offers what has become increasingly rare in the contemporary Dutch housing market: genuine spatial freedom. The numbers, however, tell only part of the story—and the gaps in those numbers demand careful interpretation.

**Understanding the Spatial Proposition**

The relationship between living area and plot size reveals a remarkably low building coverage of approximately 37%. In practical terms, this means roughly 240 square meters remain as outdoor space—a configuration that would cost significantly more to replicate in new construction, where land efficiency pressures drive building footprints ever larger relative to plots. For Petra, this translates to the garden lifestyle she envisions; for Marcel, it represents potential for future expansion or the buffer of low-density living. What the Plane C KPIs cannot convey is how this space *feels*: Is it a private oasis or exposed to neighbors? Does the garden face south for light or north in perpetual shade? These experiential dimensions await the viewing.

**The 1978 Construction Context**

The building year positions this property in an interesting construction generation—post oil-crisis building when energy awareness began emerging, yet before the stringent insulation mandates of later decades. Plane A1's age gauge reflects this: a 47-year-old structure is neither "young" enough to assume pristine condition nor "old" enough to trigger automatic historic-building concerns. It occupies the zone where condition depends entirely on maintenance history—information the registry does not contain.

**Trade-offs Implicit in the Data**

The asking price of €485,000 translates to approximately €3,415 per square meter—a figure that sits above regional averages. This premium implicitly prices the detached status, the plot generosity, and the Mierlo location. Whether this premium is justified depends on factors this chapter cannot answer: construction quality, renovation investment already made, and the intangible qualities reviewable only in person.

The tension highlighted in Plane D's Marcel-Petra comparison echoes throughout: Marcel sees the age and missing technical data as risk flags requiring investigation; Petra sees the space metrics as dream-compatible. Both readings are valid—and both are incomplete without the physical experience of the property. Chapter 1's function is to establish *what we know* so that subsequent chapters can interpret *what it means*.

# 🟥 PLANE D — HUMAN PREFERENCE

## Marcel's Assessment

### Match Score
- **Score**: 75%
- **Mood**: positive (cautious)

### What Aligns with Marcel's Priorities

1. **Complete core data availability**: 8/9 essential KPIs present allows structured analysis
2. **Spatial documentation**: Living area (142m²) and plot size (380m²) are verifiable facts, not estimates
3. **Property type confirmed**: Vrijstaand eliminates VvE complexity and shared-wall concerns
4. **Age traceable**: 1978 build year enables lifecycle planning
5. **Bebouwingsgraad low (37%)**: Technical flexibility for potential future modifications

### What Conflicts with Marcel's Priorities

1. **Missing technical fields**: Volume unknown affects HVAC calculations
2. **No floor count**: Cannot assess stair requirements or accessibility
3. **Price premium visible**: €3,415/m² is 7% above benchmark—justification needed
4. **Bathroom/toilet count unknown**: Cannot verify practical functionality
5. **Age implies deferred maintenance risk**: 47 years without renovation history

### Key Trade-offs for Marcel

| Dimension | Positive | Negative |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Data quality | High completeness (89%) | Missing functional details |
| Price position | Premium could indicate quality | Premium could indicate overpricing |
| Property type | No shared ownership complexity | Full maintenance responsibility |
| Age | Character/established neighborhood | Unknown renovation debt |

### Marcel's Summary

"The core metrics are solid and verifiable. I can work with 142m² across 6 rooms—the math works for our family. What concerns me is the gap between the *structural* facts we have and the *functional* facts we're missing. Bathrooms unknown? Floors unknown? These matter for daily living. The 7% price premium needs justification during viewing—either this house has quality that warrants it, or we're overpaying for Mierlo charm."

## Petra's Assessment  

### Match Score
- **Score**: 82%
- **Mood**: positive (enthusiastic)

### What Aligns with Petra's Priorities

1. **Generous space**: 142m² living + estimated 240m² garden = room to breathe
2. **4 bedrooms**: Space for children, guests, *and* flexible use
3. **Vrijstaand character**: Privacy, independence, personalisation freedom
4. **Plot generosity**: Garden lifestyle achievable, outdoor entertaining possible
5. **Mierlo village setting**: Community character visible in property type prevalence

### What Conflicts with Petra's Priorities

1. **No visual/emotional data**: Cannot assess light, atmosphere, condition from numbers
2. **Layout unknown**: Kitchen connection to garden? Living room brightness?
3. **1978 style question**: Is interior dated requiring renovation for desired aesthetic?
4. **Premium price**: €485k is significant—needs to *feel* worth it on viewing

### Key Trade-offs for Petra

| Dimension | Positive | Negative |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Space | Exceeds needs | May require furnishing investment |
| Garden | Large estimated area | Orientation/privacy unknown |
| Character | Period home personality | May require aesthetic updating |
| Location | Village life | Distance considerations for commute |

### Petra's Summary

"The numbers speak my language: 142 square meters, 4 bedrooms, vrijstaand with a big garden—this is the template I've been imagining. Yes, it's from 1978 and yes, there are unknowns, but those are exactly the things a viewing will reveal. I don't buy houses from spreadsheets; I buy them from the feeling when I walk in. These numbers tell me it's worth scheduling that walk-in."

## Preference Comparison

### Comparisons by Aspect

| Aspect | Marcel's View | Petra's View | Alignment |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Ruimte** | "142m² is sufficient and calculable" | "142m² is spacious and exciting" | ✅ ALIGNED (different framing, same conclusion) |
| **Prijs** | "Premium requires justification" | "Fair for what's offered" | ↔️ COMPLEMENTARY (market vs emotional value) |
| **Bouwjaar** | "47 years = maintenance timeline concern" | "47 years = character and story" | ⚡ TENSION (risk vs charm perception) |

### Overlap Points

1. Both agree: 142m² + 4 bedrooms meets family space requirements
2. Both agree: Vrijstaand > other property types for their lifestyle
3. Both agree: Viewing is essential—numbers are starting point, not endpoint
4. Both agree: Plot size (380m²) is a significant positive regardless of interpretation

### Tension Points

1. **Data interpretation**: Marcel wants complete information before emotional investment; Petra is comfortable with uncertainty
2. **Age valuation**: Marcel sees risks in 1978 construction; Petra sees opportunity and character
3. **Premium tolerance**: Marcel expects premium to be justified by tangibles; Petra accepts premium for intangibles
4. **Decision tempo**: Marcel prefers thorough investigation sequence; Petra prefers faster intuition-driven progress

## Joint Synthesis

Marcel and Petra approach Chapter 1's core data from fundamentally compatible but stylistically different angles. Marcel's 75% match score reflects satisfaction with data completeness but reservation about missing functional details and the price premium. Petra's 82% score reflects excitement about the spatial proposition with less weight given to data gaps. Their 7% gap is *healthy* divergence—not conflict. It means both will push the other: Petra prevents analysis paralysis; Marcel prevents impulsive commitment. The Chapter 1 recommendation is unified: **proceed to viewing** with Marcel's list of functional questions (bathrooms, floors, storage) and Petra's experiential radar active for atmosphere and light.
