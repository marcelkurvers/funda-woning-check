## 🚀 Phase 4: Vision & Interactive Intelligence (The Next Frontier)

Following the successful implementation of the core architecture and multi-provider AI engine, the following innovations are planned:

### 1. Multimodal "Vision" Audit
Leverage Multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro Vision) to analyze uploaded and pasted images.
*   **Maintenance Detection**: Automatic identification of window frame quality, kitchen appliance brands, and bathroom finishes.
*   **Visual Consistency Check**: verify if the description ("Luxury marble") matches the visual reality.
*   **Red Flag Discovery**: Detect damp spots, cracks, or structural anomalies in photos.

### 2. Interactive AI Advisor (Chat)
Move from a static report to a conversational consultant.
*   **Real-time Q&A**: A sidebar allowing Marcel & Petra to ask specific questions about the property (e.g., "Where could I put my fiber-optic rack?").
*   **Scenario Simulation**: "What if we renovate the attic?" – The AI recalculates Match Scores and potential value.

### 3. Smart Renovation & ROI Planner
Generate an actionable investment roadmap for every property.
*   **Cost Estimator**: AI-driven price tags for common Dutch renovations (Spouwmuur, HR++, Warmtepomp).
*   **Value-Add Prediction**: Estimate the increase in market value after specific upgrades.
*   **Energy Label Migration**: Direct path from Label G to Label A with cost/benefit analysis.

### 4. Legal "Fine Print" Scanner (RAG)
Automatic digestion of complex property dossiers.
*   **Document Analysis**: Upload VvE minutes, title deeds, and environmental reports for instant risk extraction.
*   **Hidden Risk Detection**: Highlight "Recht van Overpad," VvE contribution increases, or ground lease (erfpacht) traps.

### 5. AI Portfolio Strategist
Comparative intelligence across multiple generated reports.
*   **Portfolio Pitch**: A summary comparing Woning A, B, and C to determine which one wins for Marcel vs. which one wins for Petra.
*   **Neighborhood Forecasting**: Integration with local municipality news to predict future value based on planned infrastructure development.
