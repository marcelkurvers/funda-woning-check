# AI Woning Rapport - Innovation Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic plan for evolving the **AI Woning Rapport** from a static analysis tool into a dynamic, AI-powered real estate co-pilot.

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Multi-Check Pro Link (Completed Dec 2024)
Successfully transitioned from brittle server-side scraping to a user-mediated ingestion model.
*   **Browser Extension**: One-click ingestion for Chrome/Edge.
*   **Dynamic Interpretation Pipeline**: AI-driven attribute discovery (schema-agnostic).
*   **User-Mediated Media**: Bulk image ingestion via browser context.
*   **Category-Driven UI**: Bento dashboard that adapts to discovered data.

## 🚀 Phase 5: Vision & Interactive Intelligence (Next)

### 1. Multimodal "Vision" Audit
Leverage Multimodal LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini Pro Vision) to analyze uploaded and pasted images.
*   **Maintenance Detection**: Automatic identification of window frame quality, kitchen appliance brands, and bathroom finishes.
*   **Visual Consistency Check**: verify if the description ("Luxury marble") matches the visual reality.
*   **Red Flag Discovery**: Detect damp spots, cracks, or structural anomalies in photos.

### 2. Interactive AI Advisor (Chat)
Move from a static report to a conversational consultant.
*   **Real-time Q&A**: A sidebar allowing Marcel & Petra to ask specific questions about the property (e.g., "Where could I put my fiber-optic rack?").
*   **Scenario Simulation**: "What if we renovate the attic?" – The AI recalculates Match Scores and potential value.

### 3. Smart Renovation & ROI Planner
Generate an actionable investment roadmap for every property.
*   **Cost Estimator**: AI-driven price tags for common Dutch renovations (Spouwmuur, HR++, Warmtepomp).
*   **Value-Add Prediction**: Estimate the increase in market value after specific upgrades.

### 4. Legal "Fine Print" Scanner (RAG)
Automatic digestion of complex property dossiers.
*   **Document Analysis**: Upload VvE minutes, title deeds, and environmental reports for instant risk extraction.
*   **Hidden Risk Detection**: Highlight "Recht van Overpad," VvE contribution increases, or ground lease (erfpacht) traps.
